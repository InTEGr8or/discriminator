                    Everyone discriminates. If you're shocked by this statement, and say "I would never discriminate!", that is because <i>you</i> discriminate against discrimination.

                    Discrimination just means to <i>judge</i> one thing to be good and another to be bad.

                    Although this list may appear to reflect political groups, that similarity is only circumstantial, local, and temporary. It is important to note, however, that politics must rightfully be based on morality/ethics.
